RabbitMQ `3.12.7` is a maintenance release in the `3.12.x` [release series](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).
**All users are encouraged to skip this version in favor of [`3.12.6`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.6)**.

Please refer to the upgrade section from the [3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0)
if upgrading from a version prior to 3.12.0.

This release requires Erlang 25 and supports Erlang versions up to `26.1.x`.
[RabbitMQ and Erlang/OTP Compatibility Matrix](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) has more details on
Erlang version requirements for RabbitMQ.


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

As of 3.12.0, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 25. Nodes **will fail to start** on older Erlang releases.

Users upgrading from 3.11.x (or older releases) on Erlang 25 to 3.12.x on Erlang 26
(both RabbitMQ *and* Erlang are upgraded at the same time) **must** consult
the [v3.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v3.12.0) first.
