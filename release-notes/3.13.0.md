## RabbitMQ 3.13.0-beta.6

RabbitMQ `3.13.0-beta.6` is a preview of a new feature release.

## Highlights

This release includes several new features, optimizations, and graduates (makes mandatory) a number of feature flags.

The user-facing areas that have seen the biggest improvements in this release are

 * Support for [consumer-side stream filtering](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8207)
 * [MQTTv5 support](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/07/mqtt5)
 * A new [common message container format](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5077) used internally, based on the AMQP 1.0 message container format
 * Improved classic non-mirrored queue performance with message sizes larger than
   4 KiB (or a different customized CQ index embedding threshold)
 * Classic queues use version 2 of the storage implementation (CQv2).
   This should significantly improve performance of non-mirrored classic queues

This release also features many internal API improvements in preparation to 4.0
with [Khepri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huT-zmXvfuM).

See Compatibility Notes below to learn about breaking or potentially breaking changes in this release.

## Release Artifacts

RabbitMQ preview releases are distributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases).

[Community Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) is another installation option
for previews. It is updated with a delay (usually a few days).


## Erlang/OTP Compatibility Notes

This release [requires Erlang 26.0](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html) or later.

[Provisioning Latest Erlang Releases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html#erlang-repositories) explains
what package repositories and tools can be used to provision latest patch versions of Erlang 26.x.

## Upgrading to 3.13

### Documentation guides on upgrades

See the [Upgrading guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html) for documentation on upgrades and [RabbitMQ change log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html)
for release notes of other releases.

### Required Feature Flags

TBD

### Mixed version cluster compatibility

RabbitMQ 3.13.0 nodes can run alongside `3.12.x` nodes. `3.12.x`-specific features can only be made available when all nodes in the cluster
upgrade to 3.13.0 or any other patch release in the new series.

While operating in mixed version mode, some aspects of the system may not behave as expected. The list of known behavior changes is covered below.
Once all nodes are upgraded to 3.13.0, these irregularities will go away.

Mixed version clusters are a mechanism that allows rolling upgrade and are not meant to be run for extended
periods of time (no more than a few hours).



## Compatibility Notes

TBD


### Minimum Supported Erlang Version

Starting with this release, RabbitMQ requires Erlang 26.0 or later versions. Nodes **will fail to start**
on older Erlang releases.

### Client Library Compatibility

Client libraries that were compatible with RabbitMQ `3.12.x` will be compatible with `3.13.0`.


### Getting Help

Any questions about this release, upgrades or RabbitMQ in general are welcome on the [RabbitMQ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbitmq-users).


## Changes Worth Mentioning

Release notes are kept under [rabbitmq-server/release-notes](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/release-notes).

### Core Server

#### Enhancements

 * Messages are now internally stored using a new common heavily AMQP 1.0-influenced container format. This is a major step towards a protocol-agnostic core:
   a common format that encapsulates a sum of data types used by the protocols RabbitMQ supports, plus annotations for routng, dead-lettering state,
   and other purposes. 
  
   AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0-9-1, MQTT and STOMP have or will adopt this internal representation in upcoming releases. RabbitMQ Stream protocol already uses the AMQP 1.0 message container
   structure internally.

   This common internal format will allow for more correct and potentially efficient multi-protocol support in RabbitMQ,
   and that most cross-protocol translation rough edges can be smoothened.

   GitHub issue: [#5077](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/5077)

 * Target quorum queue replica state is now continuously reconciled.

   When the number of online replicas of a quorum queue goes below (or above) its target,
   new replicas will be automatically placed if enough cluster nodes are available.
   This is a more automatic version of how [quorum queue replicas have originally been grown](https://rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#replica-management).

   For automatic shrinking of queue replicas, the user must opt in.

   GitHub issue: [#8218](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8218)

 * Reduced memory footprint, improved memory use predictability and throughput of classic queues (version 2, or CQv2).
   This particularly benefits classic queues with longer backlogs.

   Classic queue v2 (CQv2) storage implementation **is now the default**. It is possible to switch
   the default back to CQv1 using `rabbitmq.conf`:

   ``` ini
   # uses CQv1 by default
   classic_queue.default_version = 1
   ```

   Individual queues can be declared by passing `x-queue-version` argument and/or through a `queue-version` policy.

   GitHub issue: [#8308](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8308)

 * Non-mirrored classic queues: optimizations of storage for larger (greater than 4 kiB) messages.

   GitHub issue: [#6090](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/6090), [#8507](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8507)

 * A subsystem for marking features as deprecated.

   GitHub issue: [#7390](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7390)

 * Plugins now can register custom queue types. This means that a plugin now can provide
   a custom queue type.

   GitHub issues: [#8834](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8834), [#8927](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8927)

#### Bug Fixes

This release includes all bug fixes shipped in the `3.12.x` series.

 * Feature flag discovery on a newly added node could discover an incomplete inventory of feature flags.

   GitHub issue: [#8477](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8477)

 * Feature flag discovery operations will now be retried multiple times in case of network failures.

   GitHub issue: [#8491](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8491)

 * The state of node maintenance status across the cluster is now replicated. It previously was accessible
   to all nodes but not replicated.

   GitHub issue: [#9005](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9005)


### Stream Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * Support for (consumer) stream filtering.

   This allows consumers that are only interested in a subset of data in a stream to receive
   less data. Note that false positives are possible, so this feature should be accompanied by
   client library or application-level filtering.

   GitHub issue: [#8207](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8207)


### MQTT Plugin

#### Enhancements

 * [Support for MQTTv5](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/07/mqtt5) (with limitations).

   GitHub issues: [#7263](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/7263), [#8681](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8681)

 * Negative message acknowledgements are now propagated to MQTTv5 clients.

   GitHub issue: [#9034](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/9034)

 * **Potential incompatibility**: `mqtt.subscription_ttl` configuration setting is now deprecated in favor of
   `mqtt.max_session_expiry_interval_seconds` that targets MQTTv5.

   GitHub issue: [#8846](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8846)


### AMQP 1.0 Plugin

#### Bug Fixes

 * During AMQP 1.0 to AMQP 0-9-1 conversion, the  Correlation ID message property is now stored as `x-correlation-id` (instead of `x-correlation`) for values longer than 255 bytes.

   **This is a potentially breaking change**.

   GitHub issue: [#8680](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/8680)


### Dependency Changes

 * `ra` was upgraded to [`2.6.3`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra/releases)
 * `osiris` was upgraded to [`1.6.2`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/osiris/tags)
